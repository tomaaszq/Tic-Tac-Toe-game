# Welcome in README of my game!
I'm glad that you're reading that doc, in this application I want to show you my first window-app version of Tic-Tac-Toe!

It's simple, first player is named GraczX and his symbol is 'X', second player has 'O' symbol. You have to click on place
where you want to make your move. After the game application is counting points, so you can play few times with your enemy
and see the stats. 

#have fun, i hope you'll like this!
